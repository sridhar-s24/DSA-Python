1) 

What is the time, space complexity of following code:
int a = 0, b = 0;
for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
a = a + 1;
}
for (j = 0; j < M; j++) {
b = b + j;
}


Answer: 

Time Complexity: O(N+M)
Space Complexity: O(1)


2)

What does it mean when we say that an algorithm X is asymptotically more efficient than Y?
a)X will be a better choice for all inputs
b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
c)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly large inputs
d)Y will be a better choice for small inputs

Answer:

b)X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
